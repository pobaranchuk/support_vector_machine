# support_vector_machine
Support Vector Machines are powerful machine learning models that can make complex decision boundaries. 
An SVMâ€™s decision boundary can twist and curve to accommodate the training data.

In this project, we will use an SVM trained using a baseball dataset to find the decision boundary of the strike zone.
We used the pybaseball Python package to get the data for this project
